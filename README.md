# Accuracy Maximization: CIFAR-10 Challenge for ResNet

The ResNet model has led to the establishment for the efficient training of deeper neural networks. This project describes how we achieved higher accuracy while using the same ResNet architecture and the methodology used to optimize the ResNet model with the constrain of 5 million trainable parameters on CIFAR-10 dataset.The CIFAR-10 dataset contains 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes. The hyperparameters that have the greatest influence on the model are also discussed. **Final model's pt file is ResNet.pt**

## ⚙️ Setup

1. Install all the requirements (PyTorch v1.13.0)
```shell
pip3 install torch torchvision torchaudio torchinfo tensorboard
```
2. Clone the GitHub repository
```shell
git clone (https://github.com/kaustubhagarwal/DL-Mini-Project-NYU-24)
```
3. Change directory into folder
```shell
cd ResNet5M-CIFAR10
```


## 🏁 Quick Start: using Google Colab

To run a demo file go to following google collab link: [test model](https://colab.research.google.com/github/navoday01/ResNet5M-CIFAR10/blob/main/ResnetQuickTest.ipynb)

## ⏳ Training
Run train script `ResNetTrain.py` to recreate similar model
```shell
cd models
python3 ResNetTrain.py
```
## 🖼 Testing

 To Reproduce the accuracy of the model, run `FinalTesting.py` and **ensure the model is on the right folder and change the path in the file.** This script will normalise the images to right value.
```shell
cd models
python3 FinalTesting.py
```
